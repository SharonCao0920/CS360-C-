1.Using classes, design an online address book to keep track of the names, addresses, 
phone numbers, and dates of birth of family members, close friends, and certain business 
associates. Your program should be able to handle a maximum of 500 entries.

a.Design the class dateType was designed to implement the date in a program, but the member 
function setDate and the constructor do not check whether the date is valid before storing 
the date in the member variables. Rewrite the definitions of the function setDate and the constructor so that the values for the month, day, and year are checked before storing the date into the member variables. Add a member function, isLeapYear, to check whether a year is a leap year. Moreover, write a test program to test your class.  

b.Define a class, addressType, that can store a street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Use the appropriate functions to print and store the address. Also, use constructors to automatically initialize the member variables.

c.Define a class extPersonType using the class personType as follows, the class dateType, and the class addressType. Add a member variable to this class to classify the person as a family member, friend, or business associate. Also, add a member variable to store the phone number. Add (or override) the functions to print and store the appropriate information. Use constructors to automatically initialize the member variables.

d.Define the class addressBookType using the previously defined classes. An object of the type addressBookType should be able to process a maximum of 500 entries. The program should perform the following operations:

i.Load the data into the address book from a disk.
ii.Sort the address book by last name.
iii.Search for a person by last name.
iv.Print the address, phone number, and date of birth (if it exists) of a given person.
v.Print the names of the people whose birthdays are in a given month.
vi.Print the names of all of the people between two last names.
vii.Depending on the userâ€™s request, print the names of all family members, friends, or business associates.
